# Planerrr. Week 5 Challenge. 

Not nearly as challenging as last week thank god, but still needed to spend a lot of time reviewing new concepts and applying them to the problem. Comparing notes with a couple classmates
and using the askBCS tool really helped put me in a good spot compated to past assignments, but I still feel like I'm falling short of where I need to be. Without a fair amount of help
I would not have gotten nearly as far as I did. I'm still spending a lot of time doing research and failing before reaching out for help. In the long run I think it will help and things 
will become more clear but I still can't help but feel I should be better at this already. 

I've completed most of the asks but as of a few minutes before this is due I'm missing one key piece. I'm unalble to grab the value of ids('#0900', '#1000' ect ect)and convert them to 
integers to compare against the time.
